# Examples

This folder contains example scripts that can be used to interact with
the `thor-devkit` crate.

## Quickstart

Start out by cloning the GitHub project:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/sterliakov/thor-devkit.rs.git
```

Then, simply `cd` into the project folder:

```shell
$ cd thor-devkit.rs
```

From here, you can use `cargo run` to build and run
any of the examples individually.

In particular, here's a sample usage of running `examples/my_example.rs`:

```shell
$ cargo run --example my_example
```
